# User Management

Guide to managing users and access control through the admin panel.

---

## Overview

Movie Planner uses a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with granular permissions and flexible role assignments:

- **Admin**: Full system access with bypass privileges for all operations
- **Operator**: Predefined role for scraping operations and theater management (7 specific permissions)

## Managing Existing Users

### Viewing Users

**User List Display:**
- **Username**: Unique identifier for the user
- **Role**: Current role name (admin/operator/custom) with colored badges
- **Role Type**: System or custom role indicator
- **Created Date**: When the account was created
- **Actions**: Available operations (Edit, Delete)

**List Features:**
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort by username, role, or date
- **Search**: Filter users by username (if search feature available)
- **Pagination**: Navigate through multiple pages of users

### Updating User Roles

**How to change user role:**

1. **Locate User**
   - Find the user in the user list
   - Identify current role badge

2. **Access Role Editor**
   - Click **"Edit"** button next to the user
   - Role selection dropdown appears

3. **Change Role**
   - Select new role from dropdown: admin, operator, or any custom role
   - Confirm the change
   - Role badge updates immediately

**Security Considerations:**
- **Last Admin Protection**: Cannot demote the last admin user to prevent system lockout
- **Immediate Effect**: Role changes take effect immediately
- **Session Impact**: User MUST logout/login to receive updated permissions in JWT token
- **System Role Protection**: Cannot modify or delete system roles (admin, operator)

**Best Practices:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimal required permissions via appropriate role
- **Use Custom Roles**: Create specific roles for job functions instead of using admin
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically audit user roles and permissions
- **Document Changes**: Keep record of who has admin access and why
- **Avoid Unnecessary Admins**: Limit admin accounts to essential personnel only

### Resetting Passwords

**Admin-initiated password reset:**

1. **Select User**
   - Locate user in the user list
   - Click **"Edit"** or **"Reset Password"** button

2. **Generate New Password**
   - System generates secure random password
   - Password meets all security requirements
   - Temporary password displayed once

3. **Communicate Securely**
   - Copy the generated password
   - Share with user through secure channel (not email)
   - Instruct user to change password on first login

**Important Notes:**
- **One-time Display**: Password shown only once, cannot be retrieved later
- **Immediate Effect**: Old password becomes invalid immediately
- **Security**: New password meets all complexity requirements
- **User Action Required**: User should change password on first login

### Deleting Users

**How to delete a user account:**

1. **Locate User**
   - Find user in the user list
   - Ensure this is the correct user to delete

2. **Initiate Deletion**
   - Click **"Delete"** button next to user
   - Confirmation dialog appears

3. **Confirm Action**
   - Read warning about irreversible action
   - Click **"Confirm Delete"** or **"Yes, Delete"**
   - User removed from list immediately

**Safety Guards:**
- **Cannot delete your own account**: Prevents accidental self-lockout
- **Cannot delete last admin**: Prevents system lockout
- **Confirmation required**: Prevents accidental deletion

**Irreversible Action Warning:**
- User account and all associated data permanently removed
- Cannot be undone or recovered
- User will immediately lose access to the system

### Managing Custom Roles

Custom roles provide flexibility to create specific permission sets for different job functions without granting full admin access.

#### Creating Custom Roles

**Access**: Admin users only  
**Location**: Role Management section in admin panel

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to admin panel → "Roles" section
2. Click "Create New Role" button
3. Fill in role details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive role name (e.g., "Theater Manager")
   - **Description**: Purpose and scope of the role
4. Select permissions from available categories:
   - Users, Scraper, Theaters, Settings, Reports, System, Roles
5. Save the role

#### Assigning Permissions to Roles

**Permission Categories**:
- **Users** (4): List, create, update, delete user accounts
- **Scraper** (2): Trigger global or single-theater scraping
- **Theaters** (3): Create, update, delete theater information
- **Settings** (5): Read, update, reset, export, import application settings
- **Reports** (2): List and view scraping reports
- **System** (3): View system info, health, and migration status
- **Roles** (5): List, read, create, update, delete roles and permissions

**Best Practices**:
- Start with minimal permissions and add as needed
- Group related permissions together (e.g., theater management)
- Test role functionality before assigning to users
- Document the purpose of each custom role

#### System vs Custom Role Differences

**System Roles** (`admin`, `operator`):
- Cannot be modified or deleted
- Predefined permission sets
- Admin has special bypass privileges
- Protected from accidental changes

**Custom Roles**:
- Can be created, modified, and deleted
- Flexible permission combinations
- No special bypass privileges
- Can be deleted only if no users assigned

#### Role Deletion Rules

**Cannot Delete**:
- System roles (admin, operator)
- Roles with assigned users

**Can Delete**:
- Custom roles with no assigned users

**Process**:
1. Reassign all users from the role to other roles
2. Confirm no users are assigned to the role
3. Delete the role via admin panel

   - Verify username spelling matches exactly
   - Confirm account wasn't accidentally deleted

3. **Reset password**
   - Use admin panel to reset user's password
   - Generate new secure password
   - Communicate new password securely to user

#### "Access denied" errors

**Symptoms:**
- User can login but gets "Access denied" or "Forbidden" errors
- User cannot access expected features
- Permission-related error messages

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify user role matches required permissions**
   - Check user's role in admin panel

   - Upgrade to admin role if necessary

2. **Check specific feature requirements**
   - Some features require admin role
   - Verify user is accessing appropriate sections
   - Review role-based access control rules

#### "Cannot delete user" errors

**Symptoms:**
- Delete button doesn't work
- Error message when attempting deletion
- User remains in list after delete attempt

**Solutions:**
1. **Cannot delete own account**
   - System prevents self-deletion for safety
   - Login with different admin account to delete
   - This is expected behavior, not a bug

2. **Cannot delete last admin**
   - System prevents deletion of last admin user
   - Create another admin user first
   - Then delete the original admin if needed

3. **Verify admin privileges**
   - Confirm you're logged in as admin
   - Regular users cannot delete accounts
   - Check role badge in user dropdown

#### "Password rejected" errors

**Symptoms:**
- Password doesn't meet requirements
- Form validation errors
- Cannot create or reset password

**Solutions:**
1. **Ensure password meets all requirements**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
   - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
   - At least one digit (0-9)
   - At least one special character

2. **Check for hidden characters**
   - Avoid copying passwords from documents
   - Type password manually
   - Check for extra spaces or invisible characters

### Safety Guards

**System protections in place:**

#### Cannot delete your own admin account
- **Purpose**: Prevents accidental lockout
- **Behavior**: Delete button disabled for your own account
- **Workaround**: Login with different admin to delete account

#### Username must be unique
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate accounts
- **Behavior**: Error message if username already exists
- **Solution**: Choose different username

#### Role changes require admin privileges
- **Purpose**: Prevents privilege escalation
- **Behavior**: Only admins can change user roles
- **Security**: Regular users cannot promote themselves

#### Last admin protection
- **Purpose**: Prevents complete admin lockout
- **Behavior**: Cannot demote or delete the last admin user
- **Workaround**: Create another admin first, then modify original
