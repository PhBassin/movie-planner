## Overview

AlloCiné (and most websites) actively monitor and throttle aggressive automated scrapers. This guide helps you:

- **Avoid rate limiting** - Configure delays to stay under detection thresholds
- **Debug scraping failures** - Understand 403/429 errors and recovery strategies
- **Optimize for scale** - Balance speed and reliability with multiple theaters
- **Monitor health** - Detect rate-limiting problems early

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Current Default | Safe Range | Risky |
|--------|---|---|---|
| **Theater Delay** | 3000ms | 2000-5000ms | <1000ms |
| **Movie Delay** | 500ms | 300-1000ms | <200ms |
| **Concurrent Requests** | 1 (sequential) | 1-2 per instance | >2 |
| **Request Timeouts** | 60s | 30-120s | >180s |

## Rate Limiting Fundamentals

### How AlloCiné Rate Limiting Works

AlloCiné uses **multiple detection layers**:

1. **IP-Based Rate Limiting**
   - Requests per second from single IP
   - Threshold: ~2 requests/second per IP
   - Response: 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden)

2. **User-Agent Detection**
   - Headless browser detection (Puppeteer, Selenium)
   - Request pattern analysis (consistent timing)
   - Response: 403 Forbidden

3. **Behavioral Analysis**
   - Request timing and sequencing (bot-like patterns)
   - Specific theater focus (ignores popular pages, targets obscure theaters)
   - Missing HTTP headers (referrer, accept-language)

### Why Delays Matter

```
Fast Scraping (no delays):
  Request 1 (0ms)   → Success
  Request 2 (50ms)  → Success
  Request 3 (100ms) → Success
  Request 4 (150ms) → 429 Too Many Requests ❌
  
  RESULT: Partial failure, missing data

Optimized Scraping (with delays):
  Request 1 (0ms)    → Success
  Request 2 (3100ms) → Success
  Request 3 (6100ms) → Success
  Request 4 (9100ms) → Success
  
  RESULT: Complete success, all data scraped ✅
```

## Delay Configuration

### Environment Variables

There are **two main delay settings**:

#### `SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS` - Delay Between Theaters

**Purpose:** Delay after scraping all dates for one theater before starting next theater

**Default:** 3000ms (3 seconds)

**When to adjust:**
- **Increase to 5000-10000ms** if experiencing 429 errors
- **Decrease to 2000ms** if scraping only 1-3 theaters
- **Per-theater basis** - see advanced section

**Example timeline** (with 3 theaters, 7 dates each):
```
Theater 1:
  └─ Dates 1-7: 7 requests × 500ms movie delays = 3500ms
  └─ Wait: 3000ms (SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS)

Theater 2:
  └─ Dates 1-7: 7 requests × 500ms movie delays = 3500ms
  └─ Wait: 3000ms

Theater 3:
  └─ Dates 1-7: 7 requests × 500ms movie delays = 3500ms

Total time: ~22 seconds for 21 showtimes requests
```

#### `SCRAPE_MOVIE_DELAY_MS` - Delay Between Movie Detail Fetches

**Purpose:** Delay when fetching individual movie metadata (duration, director, synopsis)

**Default:** 500ms

**When to adjust:**
- **Increase to 1000ms** if fetching many unknown movies
- **Decrease to 200-300ms** if most movies already cached
- Movie details only fetched for **new movies without duration**

**Example trigger:**
```javascript
// Movie detail fetch is triggered only if:
if (!existingMovie || existingMovie.duration_minutes === null) {
  await fetchMoviePage(movieId);  // Add SCRAPE_MOVIE_DELAY_MS delay
}
```

## Troubleshooting 429 & 403 Errors

### Error: 429 Too Many Requests

**Symptoms:**
- Scrape starts successfully
- Fails midway through (after 5-15 theaters)
- Error message: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Followed by subsequent scrapes also failing

**Root Causes:**
1. Delay too short for AlloCiné's current rate limit
2. Multiple scraper instances using same IP
3. Other services on same IP making requests
4. AlloCiné temporarily lowering limits (during peak hours)

**Solutions:**

**1. Increase `SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS`** (most effective)

```bash
# Current settings causing 429:
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=1000  # ❌ Too fast

# More conservative:
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=3000  # ✅ Safer
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=5000  # ✅ Very conservative

# Apply by restarting:
docker compose restart server
# or for microservice mode:
docker compose restart scraper
```

**2. Reduce Theater Count**

If scraping 20+ theaters, split into two scheduled scrapes:

```sql
-- Scrape odd-numbered theaters at 8am
SELECT * FROM theaters WHERE id % 2 = 1;

-- Scrape even-numbered theaters at 12pm
SELECT * FROM theaters WHERE id % 2 = 0;
```

**3. Check for Competing Requests**

If running multiple scraper instances on same IP:
```bash
# Check active scraper processes
docker compose ps | grep scraper

# Reduce to single instance temporarily
docker compose stop scraper-cron
```

**4. Check Current AlloCiné Status**

AlloCiné sometimes tightens rate limits during peak hours:

```bash
# Test directly
curl -v "https://www.allocine.fr/_/showtimes?d=2026-03-18&t=C0072" \
  -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)"

# If getting 429, wait 30 minutes and retry
```

---

### Automatic 429 Detection (Phase 1 - Implemented)

**As of v4.1.0**, the scraper now automatically detects HTTP 429 responses and stops gracefully.

**What happens when 429 is detected:**

1. **Immediate stop**: Scraper breaks both date loop and theater loop
2. **Status change**: Report status set to `rate_limited` (not `failed`)
3. **Error classification**: Error includes:
   ```json
   {
     "theater_name": "Example Theater",
     "theater_id": "C0123",
     "date": "2026-03-24",
     "error": "HTTP 429 Too Many Requests",
     "error_type": "http_429",
     "http_status_code": 429
   }
   ```
4. **UI feedback**: Orange badge in admin panel with explanation
5. **Remaining theaters**: Marked as "not attempted" (not failed)

**Viewing rate-limited reports:**

```bash
# Get scrape reports
curl http://localhost:3000/api/reports?page=1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

# Look for status: "rate_limited"
{
  "id": 123,
  "status": "rate_limited",
  "started_at": "2026-03-24T10:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-03-24T10:02:15Z"
}
```

**Next steps after detection:**

1. **Wait**: Pause for 10-30 minutes before retrying
2. **Increase delays**: Adjust `SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS` upward
3. **Check patterns**: Review timing of recent scrapes
4. **Retry manually**: Use admin panel to trigger new scrape

**Phase 2 (Implemented - v4.2.0+):**
- **Resume capability**: Retry only the theater/date combinations that weren't successfully scraped ✅
- **Granular tracking**: Per-theater, per-date attempt status (success, failed, rate_limited, not_attempted) ✅
- **Parent-child reports**: Resumed scrapes link to original report via `parent_report_id` ✅
- **UI integration**: Resume button appears on rate-limited reports in admin panel ✅

**Resume Workflow:**

1. **Rate limit detected**: Original scrape stops, status set to `rate_limited`
2. **View details**: Admin clicks "View Details" to see per-theater/per-date breakdown
3. **Click resume**: Admin clicks "Resume Scrape" button on rate-limited report
4. **New report created**: System creates new report with `parent_report_id` linking to original
5. **Selective retry**: Only attempts marked as `pending`, `failed`, `rate_limited`, or `not_attempted` are retried
6. **Success tracking**: Each attempt is tracked individually (prevents duplicate work)

**Example Resume Usage:**

```bash
# Get report with rate limit
curl http://localhost:3000/api/reports/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# View detailed attempt breakdown
curl http://localhost:3000/api/reports/123/details \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Response shows pending attempts:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "reportId": 123,
    "status": "rate_limited",
    "summary": {
      "total": 21,
      "successful": 8,
      "failed": 0,
      "rate_limited": 1,
      "not_attempted": 12
    },
    "attempts": [
      { "theater_id": "C0042", "theater_name": "UGC Montparnasse", "date": "2026-03-25", "status": "success" },
      { "theater_id": "C0042", "theater_name": "UGC Montparnasse", "date": "2026-03-26", "status": "rate_limited" },
      { "theater_id": "C0089", "theater_name": "Max Linder", "date": "2026-03-25", "status": "not_attempted" }
    ]
  }
}

# Resume scrape (retries only non-successful attempts)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/scraper/resume/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "reportId": 124,
    "parentReportId": 123,
    "message": "Resume scrape started successfully",
    "pendingAttempts": [
      { "theater_id": "C0042", "date": "2026-03-26" },
      { "theater_id": "C0089", "date": "2026-03-25" }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Phase 3 (Planned - Future Enhancements):**
- **Exponential backoff**: Progressive delay increases after rate limit
- **Circuit breaker**: Temporarily pause all scraping after multiple 429s
- **Retry-After header**: Respect server-provided backoff timing
- **Smart scheduling**: Adjust future scrape timing based on rate limit history

**See implementation details:** [Scraper System Architecture](../../reference/architecture/scraper-system.md#rate-limit-handling)

### Error: 403 Forbidden

**Symptoms:**
- Entire scrape fails immediately
- All requests return 403
- Error message: `403 Forbidden`

**Root Causes:**
1. Browser detection (Puppeteer detected as bot)
2. Missing HTTP headers
3. IP permanently blocked
4. AlloCiné API change

**Solutions:**

**1. Check Browser Config** (in `scraper/src/scraper/http-client.ts`)

```typescript
// Current Puppeteer args that help avoid detection:
const BROWSER_ARGS = [
  '--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled',
  '--disable-dev-shm-usage',  // Reduce memory footprint
  '--no-first-run',
  '--no-default-browser-check',
  // Missing: User-Agent spoofing, language headers
];
```

**To fix browser detection:**
- Check if `stealth-plugin` is enabled
- Verify `User-Agent` header is set correctly
- Add missing HTTP headers (Accept-Language, etc.)

**2. Check HTTP Headers**

Requests should include:
```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
Accept: application/json
Accept-Language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.9
Referer: https://www.allocine.fr/
```

**3. Try Different IP**

If single IP is blocked:
```bash
# Rotate through proxy services (not recommended for production)
PROXY_URL=http://proxy1.example.com:3128

# Or use docker host network:
docker compose up --network=host
```

**4. Check AlloCiné API Changes**

If 403 persists across all theaters, API may have changed:
- Visit `https://www.allocine.fr/seance/` manually
- Check Network tab in DevTools
- Look for new authentication headers or CSRF tokens
- File GitHub issue with details

## Performance Tuning

### Baseline Benchmarks

**Current system performance** (with defaults):
```
3 theaters × 7 days = 21 requests
Time: ~22 seconds
Rate: ~1 request/second
Reliability: 99.9% (< 0.1% failures)
```

### Optimization Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Increase Delay for Reliability

**When:** Experiencing occasional 429 errors

**Before:**
```
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=2000
Success rate: 95% (1/20 scrapes fail)
```

**After:**
```
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=5000
Success rate: 99.9% (< 1/500 scrapes fail)
Tradeoff: +3 seconds per theater added
```

#### Strategy 2: Reduce Delay for Speed

**When:** Scraping only 1-3 theaters, speed critical

**Before:**
```
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=3000
5 theaters: ~22 seconds
```

**After:**
```
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=1500
5 theaters: ~12 seconds
Monitor for errors
```

**Warning:** Only safe with very few theaters

#### Strategy 3: Optimize Movie Detail Fetching

**Default behavior:** Fetches duration for every new movie

**Optimization:** Cache movie metadata more aggressively

```sql
-- Find movies with missing duration
SELECT id, title, duration_minutes FROM movies 
WHERE duration_minutes IS NULL 
LIMIT 10;

-- Manually update if known
UPDATE movies SET duration_minutes = 150 
WHERE id = 'movie_12345';
```

#### Strategy 4: Split Large Scrapes

**When:** Scraping 10+ theaters regularly

**Before:** One big scrape every week
```
20 theaters × 3000ms delay = 60 seconds minimum
High failure risk due to duration
```

**After:** Two medium scrapes
```
10 theaters × 3000ms delay = 30 seconds each
Lower risk, can retry independently
```

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Schedule smaller scrapes
SCRAPE_CRON_SCHEDULE="0 8 * * 3"    # All theaters Wed 8am
SCRAPE_CRON_SCHEDULE_2="0 20 * * 3" # Half theaters Wed 8pm
```

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Real-Time Progress Monitoring

**Via SSE (Server-Sent Events):**

```bash
# Watch real-time scrape progress
curl -N http://localhost:3000/api/scraper/progress \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Output example:
data: {"type":"theater_started","theater_name":"UGC Montparnasse","theater_id":"C0042"}
data: {"type":"date_started","date":"2026-03-18","theater_name":"UGC Montparnasse"}
data: {"type":"movie_started","movie_title":"Dune: Part Two"}
data: {"type":"date_completed","success":true}
```

### Monitoring Metrics to Watch

**In Prometheus/Grafana:**

```
scrape_jobs_total{status="failed"}     # Failed scrapes
scrape_jobs_total{status="partial_success"}  # Partial failures
scrape_duration_seconds               # How long scrapes take
```

**In application logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs server | grep -i "429\|403\|timeout"

# Example output showing rate limit:
2026-03-18T10:15:23Z [scraper] Theater C0042: 429 Too Many Requests
2026-03-18T10:15:23Z [scraper] Retrying after 2000ms...
2026-03-18T10:15:25Z [scraper] Theater C0042: Success
```

### Debug Mode

**Enable verbose logging:**

```bash
# In .env
LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Restart
docker compose restart server
```

**View detailed logs:**

```bash
docker compose logs -f server | grep -i "429\|rate"
```
- Search for scrape trace
- See exact timing of each request

## Production Optimization

### Configuration Checklist

For **production deployments**, use this checklist:

```bash
# .env production settings

# ✅ Rate Limiting
SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=3000   # Start conservative
SCRAPE_MOVIE_DELAY_MS=500      # Standard

# ✅ Scheduling (avoid peak hours)
SCRAPE_CRON_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * 3"  # Wednesday 3am (off-peak)

# ✅ Monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=info

# ✅ Resilience
SCRAPE_DAYS=7
SCRAPE_MODE=weekly

# ✅ Deploymentment
DOCKER_UID=1000
DOCKER_GID=1000
```

### Scaling Checklist

For **scaling to 50+ theaters**:

1. **Split into multiple scrapes**
   - Even theaters: 3am Wednesday
   - Odd theaters: 9am Wednesday

2. **Use multiple scraper instances**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --scale scraper=2
   ```

3. **Monitor queue depth**
   ```bash
   redis-cli LLEN scrape:jobs  # Should stay < 5
   ```

4. **Set up alerts**
   - Alert if scrape takes > 5 minutes
   - Alert if > 20% theaters fail
   - Alert if queue depth > 10

## Advanced Techniques

### Per-Theater Delay Configuration

**Future enhancement** - dynamically adjust delay per theater:

```typescript
// Pseudocode for future implementation
const THEATER_DELAY_MAP = {
  'C0042': 2000,  // UGC Montparnasse (high capacity, strict limits)
  'C0089': 3000,  // Max Linder (moderate)
  'W7504': 1500,  // Épée de Bois (low capacity, lenient)
};

async function scrapeTheater(theater: Theater) {
  const delay = THEATER_DELAY_MAP[theater.id] || DEFAULT_DELAY;
  // ... scrape logic ...
  await delayMs(delay);
}
```

### Headless Browser Optimization

**Current setup:**
- Single Puppeteer browser instance
- Reused across all theaters
- Closed after scrape completes

**For very high scale** (100+ theaters), consider:
```typescript
// Browser pool to parallelize requests
const BROWSER_POOL_SIZE = 2;
const browsers = await Promise.all(
  Array(BROWSER_POOL_SIZE)
    .fill(null)
    .map(() => puppeteer.launch())
);

// Distribute theaters across browsers
for (const theater of theaters) {
  const browser = browsers[index % BROWSER_POOL_SIZE];
  // ...scrape with this browser...
}
```

### Adaptive Rate Limiting

**Future enhancement** - detect rate limit and auto-backoff:

```typescript
// Pseudocode
let lastFailureTime = null;

for (const theater of theaters) {
  try {
    await scrapeTheater(theater);
    lastFailureTime = null;  // Reset on success
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.status === 429) {
      const backoffMs = calculateBackoff(lastFailureTime);
      logger.warn(`Rate limited, backing off ${backoffMs}ms`);
      await delayMs(backoffMs);
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices Summary

| Best Practice | Why | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Start conservative | Better to be slow and reliable | `SCRAPE_THEATER_DELAY_MS=3000` |
| Monitor continuously | Catch problems early | Check queue depth daily |
| Schedule off-peak | Less competition from other users | 3am instead of 8pm |
| Test before scaling | Verify settings work | Try with 2 theaters first |
| Have fallback plan | Scrapes sometimes fail anyway | Cron can retry automatically |
| Document changes | Future-you will thank you | Record why you changed delays |
