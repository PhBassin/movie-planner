## Debugging Tools

### Check Service Health
```bash
# All services
docker compose ps

# Logs for specific service
docker compose logs server
docker compose logs db

# Follow logs
docker compose logs -f server
```

### Database Access
```bash
# Connect to database
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -d ics

# Check tables
\dt

# Check connections
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;
```

### API Testing
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'
```

### Scraper Debugging
```bash
# Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}' | jq -r '.data.token')

# Check scraper status (requires auth)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3000/api/scraper/status
